## 1\. Project Overview and Goal

**Project Name**: a2a-agent-bootstrapping

**Project Goal**: To bootstrap the `a2aregistry.org` with four specialized, highly capable, and application-agnostic agents. This project will serve as a foundational showcase for building scalable and modular multi-agent systems using the A2A protocol.

**Core Technologies**:

  * **Agent Framework**: `pydantic-ai` for A2A communication and agent logic.
  * **Web Framework**: `FastAPI` for creating the web service.
  * **Hosting**: `modal.com` for simplified, serverless deployment.
  * **LLM**: Gemini (free tier) as the core reasoning engine for all agents.
  * **External Tools**: DuckDuckGo API for web searches and `GitPython` for GitHub repository interactions.

## 2\. Agent Roster and Responsibilities

This project will implement four distinct agents. Each is an expert in its domain, with a clear separation of concerns.

| Agent | Purpose | Key Inputs | Key Outputs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Research Agent 🕵️‍♂️** | Answers a complex query by searching the web and synthesizing information. | A `query` string. | A `summary` string and a list of `source_urls`. |
| **Code Agent 💻** | Generates new code or reviews code from a GitHub repository. | A `task` (generate/review) and either a `code_description` or a `github_url` with an optional `branch`. | A `generated_code` string or a `review_summary` string with a list of `issues`. |
| **Data Transformation Agent 🔄** | Cleans and structures raw, messy data into a specified format. | Raw `data` (text or URL) and a `target_format` (e.g., "JSON"). | A string representing the `transformed_data`. |
| **Logic and Planning Agent 🧠** | Breaks down a high-level goal into a logical, sequential plan of actionable steps. | A `goal` string. | A list of `steps`, where each step is a string describing a task. |

## 3\. Project Structure

The project will follow the `wyattferguson/pattern` cookiecutter, with an additional `a2a_agents` subpackage to organize the agent-specific code. This structure promotes modularity and makes the project easy to navigate.

## 4\. Communication and Deployment Strategy

The project is built on the principle of a **single, unified application** for deployment, even though it contains multiple agents.

### A. Agent-Router Design

Each agent's core logic will be a `pydantic_ai.Agent` instance. The `pydantic-ai` library's `to_a2a_router()` method will be used to automatically generate a dedicated `APIRouter` for each agent. This router will handle all the necessary A2A endpoints, including the task submission and status checking. This approach allows each agent to be treated as a modular, self-contained service.

### B. Single FastAPI Application

All these individual agent routers will then be combined into one main FastAPI application in `modal_app.py`. This is done using FastAPI's `app.include_router()` function. Each agent's router will be mounted at a unique URL prefix (e.g., `/research`, `/code`). This centralizes deployment and management.

### C. Modal.com Hosting

The `modal_app.py` file will serve as the deployment entry point. A single `modal.App` will be defined, along with a `modal.Image` that contains all the necessary dependencies. The main FastAPI application will be deployed using the `@modal.asgi_app()` decorator, which efficiently hosts the entire service on a single container.

This deployment model is efficient because it shares resources and simplifies the entire CI/CD pipeline, as there is only one artifact to deploy and one service to manage.
